  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

  <p>This document describes a game called “Space Delivery”, which is designed to be a simple, 2D side-scrolling shooter game. 
    The game will employ sprite-based animation, an imaged background, physics, AI, auto-scrolling, and more 2D game techniques.</p>
<br />

  <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>

  <p>Space Delivery will be developed for the Windows Platform using McKilla's Gorilla game engine, a bare-bones engine 
    <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~richard">Richard McKenna</a> developed for rapid prototyping 2D games. 
    All art in the game will be mostly created with Paskel and will be on the simple side.</p>
<br />

  <h3>BACKSTORY</h3>
  <p>You play as an employee of the “Galaxy Delivery Service” (GDS for short). One day on your delivery route, aliens, 
    or what you think they are, attack you. You, being too underpaid to care, decide to just finish the run and go home.</p>
<br />

  <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>

  <p>Your task is to pilot your ship and defend yourself from the oncoming aliens attacking your ship to make sure that your shipment doesn't get damaged or stolen.
    You are armed with an average delivery ship with minimal weapons, however, you can upgrade your ship to have better weapons.</p>
<br />

  <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>
  <p>The game would work as an auto scroller scrolling upwards. You are able to move around the screen while shooting at enemies, 
    you have a booster and a temporary shield that you can deploy.</p>

  <p>You would have to be careful as enemies can also shoot at you and attack you in different formations. When they get impaient, they will even come and ram you</p>

  <p>
    When an enemy is defeated, they have a chance of dropping scrap, the material that you use to repair and upgrade your ship.
