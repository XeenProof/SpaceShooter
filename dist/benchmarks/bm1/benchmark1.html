  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

  <p>This document describes a game called “Space Delivery”, which is designed to be a simple, 2D side-scrolling shooter game. 
    The game will employ sprite-based animation, an imaged background, physics, AI, auto-scrolling, and more 2D game techniques.</p>
<br />

  <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>

  <p>Space Delivery will be developed for the Windows Platform using McKilla's Gorilla game engine, a bare-bones engine 
    <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~richard">Richard McKenna</a> developed for rapid prototyping 2D games.</p>
<br />

  <h3>BACKSTORY</h3>
  <p>You play as an employee of the “Galaxy Delivery Service” (GDS for short). One day on your delivery route, aliens, 
    or what you think they are, attack you. You, being too underpaid to care, decide to just finish the run and go home.</p>
<br />

  <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>

  <p>Your task is to pilot your ship and defend yourself from the oncoming aliens attacking your ship to make sure that your product doesn't get damaged or stolen.
    You are armed with an average delivery ship with minimal weapons, however, you can upgrade your ship to have better weapons.</p>
<br />

  <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>
  <p>The game would work as an auto scroller scrolling upwards. You are able to move around the screen while shooting at enemies, 
    you have a booster and a temporary shield that you can deploy.</p>

  <p>You would have to be careful as enemies can also shoot at you and attack you in different formations. When they get impaient, they will even come and ram you</p>

  <p>
    When an enemy is defeated, they have a chance of dropping scrap, the material that you use to repair and upgrade your ship.
  </p>
  <p>WIP</p>

  <!-- <p>The game will work like a side scroller, with Spike able to run left and right, and jump up or down onto platforms and other surfaces such that we may scroll up and down.</p>

  <p>Spike will have to be extra careful because there are three different kinds of acids, and three different kinds of suits. Each suit protects Spike from only on particular type of acid. Balloons are color-coded Red, Blue and Green to distinguish between these different acid types, as are the acid-proof suits. Suit protection works as follows:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>When Spike is wearing the Red suit, he is protected from Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), found in the Red Balloons. This is the most dangerous of the three acids to Spike, and will do the most damage.</li>
    <li>When Spike is wearing the Green suit, he is protected from Sulfuric Acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), found in the Green Balloons. This is the second most dangerous of the three acids, and will do the seond most damage.</li>
    <li>When Spike is wearing the Blue suit, he is protected from Nitric Acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), found in the Blue Balloons. This will do the least damage to Spike of the three.</li>
   </ul>

  <p>To change suits, Spike will have to return to the changing room, which will be his start location. Once in the changing room, Spike can select the colored suit he wishes to wear.</p>

  <p>The acid-protective suits have a strange effect on the room and as a result the balloons. And so, depending on the suit being worn by Spike, the balloons will behave differently as follows:</p> -->

<!-- <table border="5" cellpadding="5">
 <tr align="center">
  <th>Suit Color in Use</th>
  <th>Red Balloon Effect</th>
  <th>Blue Balloon Effect</th>
  <th>Green Balloon Effect</th>
 </tr>
 <tr align="center">
  <td>Red</td>
  <td>No Gravity</td>
  <td>+ Gravity (sinks)</td>
  <td>- Gravity (rises)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align="center">
  <td>Green</td>
  <td>- Gravity (rises)</td>
  <td>No Gravity</td>
  <td>+ Gravity (sinks)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align="center">
  <td>Blue</td>
  <td>+ Gravity (sinks)</td>
  <td>- Gravity (rises)</td>
  <td>No Gravity</td>
 </tr>
</table> -->

<br />

  <h3>CONTROLS</h3>

  <p>This game will be played using only a keyboard</p>

   <ul>
    <li><strong>W</strong> - Move Up</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong> - Move Left</li>
    <li><strong>S</strong> - Move Down</li>
    <li><strong>D</strong> - Move Right</li>
    <li><strong>SPACE</strong> - Shoot</li>
    <li><strong>E</strong> - Activates Shield</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> - Activates Booster</li>
    <li><strong>ESC</strong> - Pauses the Game</li>
   </ul>
<br />

  <h3>GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</h3>
  <p>WIP</p>

  <!-- <p>As far as the GUI is concerned, if we consider</p>

  <ul>
   <li><strong>Splash Screen</strong> - The splash screen GUI simply presents a game logo and a Start button for the user to press when they are ready to play. Upon pressing it, a brief scripted sequence is played explaining a little about Spike and the back story for the game. While playing the message "Press ESC to Skip" should be displayed at the bottom of the screen. If pressed, the game should immediately start.</li>
<br />

   <li><strong>In-Game Menu</strong> - While the game is in progress, we'll always have a game menu that allows the player to select from the following options:
    <ul>
     <li><strong>New Game</strong> - If a game is in progress, first we'll pop up a dialog to make sure the user really wants to quit the current game. If we conclude the user really wants to start a game, then the game state is reset and begun.</li>
     <li><strong>Pause Game</strong> - This button is deactivated when a game is not in progress. If pressed, it will produce the same effect as the ESC key.</li>
     <li><strong>Display Controls</strong> - If pressed, the game will display an info screen that includes a description of all game controls.</li>
     <li><strong>Best Times</strong> - If pressed, the game will display an info screen with the fastest times for clearing the level.</li>
     <li><strong>About</strong> - If pressed, the game will display an info screen with information about the game author.</li>
     <li><strong>Exit</strong> - If pressed, the game program will exit.</li>
    </ul></li>
<br />

   <li><strong>In-Game GUI</strong> - Once a game starts, a 5-4-3-2-1-Begin sequence is counted down and displayed for the player to see. At Begin, the changing room door opens and Spike pops out in his Red protective suit. Balloons will begin to be deployed about the chamber. While playing the following will be displayed at all times:
    <ul>
     <li>Time Remaining</li>
     <li>Popped Red Balloons/Red Balloons Remaining</li>
     <li>Popped Green Balloons/Green Balloons Remaining</li>
     <li>Popped Blue Balloons/Blue Balloons Remaining</li>
    </ul>
   In addition, three buttons will be be part of the in-game GUI, meaning overlayed on top of the game world. These are buttons for selecting Red, Green, and Blue suits. These buttons will only be selectable when Spike is standing in front of the changing room door. If Spike is in front of the door and the player clicks on a suit colored differently than the one Spike is currently wearing, then the door will slide open, Spike will disappear inside momentarily, the door will then slide closed, and then will slide open again, with Spike popping out in his new suit.</li>
  </ul>
<br /> -->

  <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
  <P>WIP</P>

  <!-- <p>All artwork in the game will be original. The following needs to be created:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><strong>Spike</strong> - we'll only dress Spike in his acid-proof gear, so we'll need to make artwork for him in his Red, Green, and Blue outfits. Each will require animations for:
    <ul>
     <li>Walking Right</li>
     <li>Walking Left</li>
     <li>Jumping Right</li>
     <li>Jumping Left</li>
     <li>Jumping Up</li>
     <li>Collide With Floor at high speed</li>
     <li>Taking Damage</li>
     <li>Dying</li>
    </ul></li>
<br />
   <li><strong>Red, Green &amp; Blue Balloons</strong> - Simple sprites, each require animations for:
    <ul>
     <li>Floating about the chamber</li>
     <li>Colliding with something below it</li>
     <li>Colliding with something above it</li>
     <li>Colliding with something to the right of it</li>
     <li>Colliding with something to the left of it</li>
     <li>Popping, with acid bursting out</li>
    </ul></li>
<br />

   <li><strong>Changing Room Door</strong> - Spike will start the game exiting from the changing room in his Red suit. We will not see the inside of the changing room, just a sliding metal door that opens and closes when Spike walks up to it and presses either R, G, or B. For this, we'll need an animatino of the sliding door opening and closing.</li>
<br />

   <li><strong>Ceiling, Floor, &amp; Wall Tiles</strong> - The test chamber will have multiple floors and platforms to jump onto and off of. We'll use simple tiles for all walkable/collidable surfaces. These tiles will have to clearly define where the walkable surface is. We'll use straight, dark grey, slightly grooved walking surfaces.</li>
<br />

   <li><strong>Chamber Background Tiles</strong> - For non-collidable tiles that will go in the background of the chamber, we'll just use a black and white tile set arranged in some pattern.</li>
  </ul>
<br /> -->



  <h3>SOUND EFFECTS</h3>

  <p>All sound effects will be original. Sounds must be made to coincide with each of the following events:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Shielding</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Boosting</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Shooting</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Enemy Shooting</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Bullet Hit Enemy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Bullet Hit Player</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Dying</strong></li>
   </ul>
<br />

  <h3>MUSIC</h3>
  <p>If time permits, Game Music will be added.</p>
